# What is this?
GitCode is a Chinese code hosting website... on the surface. It's owned by a "developer community" called CSDN, which is well known to be predatory: has aggressive SEO optimization to get top spots in search engines, requires payment to download any shared files (and has a minimum payment of a few dozen dollars - you can't just pay exactly what you need), has copy prevention, and only shows a preview of each article in the browser, requiring their mobile app to read the whole thing (... to be clear, this behavior has been disallowed in China!).

Enough sidetracking - GitCode is, on the surface, a GitHub-like website, but instead of just having users submit their repos, they copy paste GitHub repos, and also making sure to convert all references to GitHub to GitCode. Combined with its high SEO ranking, it makes a casual searcher more likely to find a repo's GitCode clone instead of its GitHub original version, and because all references to GitHub have been replaced, it also makes people unlikely to find out there was a GitHub version to begin with. It also creates fake versions of user profiles to further sell the illusion.

This very repo you are looking at is obviously to express disapproval towards GitCode and CSDN. It likely contains strong language, as you can expect from any internet venting.

# Am I affected?
If your repo has more than a few dozen stars, then likely yes. However, it may not be immediately obvious whether your repo had been cloned, as GitCode has been trying to hide evidence of their "work" on their website.

# How do I minimize its impact on my work?

Here are a few things you could do:

## Add something undesirable for a Chinese website

Consider adding some political mentions and/or NSFW contents to your repo, if it does not affect your repo's regular operation.

Only do this if you and all your contributors are **not** Chinese citizen: adding these contents may cause some risk for your Chinese contributors.

## Add some text to the readme

Add some text warning people of GitCode on your readme, stating that any clones on GitCode are not from you, and may even contain malicious code.

Do keep in mind that GitCode replaces any mention of "GitHub" with "GitCode", so you likely cannot simply put a GitHub link in there.

## Request removal

Email: kefu@gitcode.com

Issues: https://gitcode.com/Gitcode-offical-team/GitCode-Docs/issues

You may request removal of your repo by sending a message to them. They *may* not comply with your request, *especially if you are a Mainland Chinese citizen*.
