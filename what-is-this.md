# What is this?
GitCode is a Chinese code hosting website... on the surface. It's owned by a "developer community" called CSDN, which is well known to be predatory: has aggressive SEO optimization to get top spots in search engines, requires payment to download any shared files (and has a minimum payment of a few dozen dollars - you can't just pay exactly what you need), has paste prevention, and only shows a preview of each article in the browser, requiring their mobile app to read the whole thing (... to be clear, this behavior has been disallowed in China!).

Enough sidetracking - GitCode is, on the surface, a GitHub-like website, but instead of just having users submit their repos, they copy paste GitHub repos, and also making sure to convert all references to GitHub to GitCode. Combined with its high SEO ranking, it makes a casual searcher more likely to find a repo's GitCode clone instead of its GitHub original version, and because all references to GitHub have been replaced, it also makes people unlikely to find out there was a GitHub version to begin with. It also creates fake versions of user profiles to further sell the illusion.

This very repo you are looking at is obviously to express disapproval towards GitCode and CSDN. It likely contains strong language, as you can expect from any internet venting.
